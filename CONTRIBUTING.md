# Contributing to OpenCode Router

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **OpenCode Router**! We welcome bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code contributions.

## Code of Conduct

Please treat all members of the community with respect, patience, and courtesy.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Check the [Issues tab](https://github.com/EhsanCreator/OpenCode-Router/issues) to ensure the bug or feature hasn't already been reported.
- When opening a new issue, describe the problem clearly, including:
  - Your Ubuntu version (`lsb_release -a`)
  - Node.js version (`node -v`)
  - OpenCode version (`opencode --version`)
  - Reproduction steps and error logs (sanitize any private server endpoints or credentials before posting)

### Developing Locally
1. Fork and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EhsanCreator/OpenCode-Router.git
   cd OpenCode-Router
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the automated test suite:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. Start in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:backend
   # In another terminal:
   npm run dev:frontend
   ```

### Coding Standards
- Write clean, maintainable TypeScript.
- Follow least-privilege security principles: never require root unless strictly necessary.
- Respect host environment isolation: do not modify global OS routing or interfere with other applications.
- Run tests (`npm test`) and ensure the frontend compiles (`npm run build`) before submitting pull requests.
