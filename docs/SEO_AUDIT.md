# Comprehensive SEO & Discoverability Audit: OpenCode Router

**Project**: OpenCode Router  
**Repository**: [https://github.com/EhsanCreator/OpenCode-Router](https://github.com/EhsanCreator/OpenCode-Router)  
**Author**: Ehsan Shahryari ([@EhsanCreator](https://github.com/EhsanCreator))  
**Release Target**: v1.0.0  
**Verified Platform**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (64-bit x86_64)  
**Date of Audit**: November 2026

## 1. Executive Summary

This audit assesses the organic discoverability, technical search engine optimization (SEO), GitHub search optimization, and informational architecture of the **OpenCode Router** repository. 

OpenCode Router addresses a distinct, urgent technical friction point: **connectivity failures, CDN blocks, and IP-level HTTP 429 rate limits experienced by OpenCode users on Linux**. Traditional VPNs enforce system-wide TUN routing that disrupts general developer workflows (e.g., local servers, SSH sessions, database sockets). OpenCode Router solves this via unprivileged user-space proxying (SOCKS5/HTTP) dedicated strictly to OpenCode via `bin/opencode-vpn`.

### Primary Audit Finding
While the underlying TypeScript codebase, testing framework, and modern web GUI are robust and fully functional, the project initially lacked discoverability metadata, targeted keyword alignment, technical problem-solving articles, and search-indexed documentation. Implementing targeted GitHub metadata, search-intent-aligned technical articles, and structured documentation will enable developers encountering OpenCode network errors to find the repository organically.

> [!NOTE]
> **SEO Disclaimer**: Search engine optimization, keyword indexing, and repository presentation improve discoverability and relevance for interested users, but do not guarantee specific search rankings, traffic volumes, or GitHub star counts.

## 2. Target Audience Segmentation

The project serves seven identifiable developer profiles:

| Audience Segment | Primary Search Intent | Core Pain Point |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OpenCode CLI Users** | Finding a working proxy or routing solution for OpenCode | OpenCode fails to complete requests due to regional blocks or network drops. |
| **AI Coding Assistant Developers** | Managing rate limits across command-line AI coding tools | Free-tier provider limits or IP throttle (HTTP 429) interrupting coding flow. |
| **Linux / Ubuntu Developers** | Configuring non-disruptive proxies on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS | Standard VPN clients hijack system-wide DNS and routing, breaking local workflows. |
| **HTTP 429 / Rate Limit Searchers** | Resolving `429 Too Many Requests` in terminal AI agents | Differentiating account-level token depletion from IP-based CDN rate limits. |
| **Network & Privacy Engineers** | Running Xray-core / V2Ray in unprivileged user space | Routing specific CLI tools without requiring root (`sudo`) access. |
| **Open-Source Tool Adopters** | Looking for automated node discovery and latency testing | Manual proxy configuration parsing (VLESS/VMess/Trojan) is tedious and error-prone. |
| **Remote / Restricted Region Coders** | Accessing AI developer APIs reliably | Strict firewalls blocking AI API endpoints while developer needs stable tool access. |

## 3. Current State & Gap Analysis

### 3.1 Repository Metadata & Discoverability
- **Repository Name**: `OpenCode-Router` — Strong, concise, and descriptive.
- **Repository Description**:
  - *Previous*: Empty or basic placeholder.
  - *Recommended*: `"Automated proxy discovery, testing, and intelligent routing for OpenCode. Fix connectivity issues and IP-based rate limits with Xray/V2Ray on Linux."` (153 characters, perfectly fits GitHub's 350-character limit and Google's 160-character SERP snippet).
- **GitHub Topics**:
  - *Previous*: None configured on remote.
  - *Gap*: Missing topically relevant tags like `opencode`, `xray`, `v2ray`, `proxy`, `rate-limit`, `ubuntu`, `ai-coding-assistant`.
- **Social Preview Image**:
  - *Previous*: Default GitHub gradient avatar.
  - *Gap*: Reduces click-through rate when shared on Twitter/X, Reddit, or Discord.

### 3.2 README Structure & Keyword Alignment
- **Title**: Clear and branded.
- **Heading Hierarchy**: H1 for title, H2 for major sections, H3 for sub-features. Logical and machine-readable.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Previous drafts casually listed multiple Linux distributions. The implementation is verified specifically on **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (64-bit x86_64)**. The README must accurately distinguish verified from untested environments.
- **Keyword Density**: Natural technical terminology was present, but specific long-tail problem keywords (e.g., `"OpenCode HTTP 429"`, `"OpenCode network error"`, `"OpenCode SOCKS5 proxy"`) were under-represented in headings and body text.
- **Alt Text on Screenshots**: Previous image tags lacked descriptive alt text. They must use descriptive text (e.g., `alt="OpenCode Router web dashboard showing verified low-latency proxy node and OpenCode connection status"`).

### 3.3 Documentation Architecture
- **Article Depth**: The repository had a single `README.md`. Single-page repositories struggle to rank for varied, distinct search queries because one page cannot comprehensively answer multiple distinct technical questions without keyword stuffing.
- **Solution**: Creation of dedicated technical troubleshooting articles in `docs/articles/` addressing specific queries (network errors, HTTP 429, CLI proxy setup, Xray configuration, proxy vs VPN comparison).

### 3.4 Trust Signals & Code Quality
- **Test Suite**: Automated end-to-end tests (`tests/test-scenarios.ts`) verify all 8 acceptance criteria (A-G).
- **Licensing**: Explicit MIT License with full author attribution.
- **Security & Least Privilege**: Clear explanation of unprivileged high-port loopback sockets (`127.0.0.1:10808`/`10809`), zero root requirement, and sanitized configuration cache.
- **Limitations**: Transparent disclosure that account-level token exhaustion cannot be bypassed by IP rotation.

## 5. Documentation Architecture & Static Site Evaluation

Search engines index standalone documentation websites with hierarchical URL structures more effectively than single long Markdown files.

### Comparison: README vs. GitHub Pages vs. Custom Domain

| Criteria | README-Only | GitHub Pages (Subpath) | Custom Domain Documentation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Setup Overhead** | Zero | Minimal (built-in GitHub feature) | Moderate (DNS, SSL, hosting) |
| **Google Indexing** | Single GitHub URL indexed | Every article gets a distinct canonical URL | Full ownership of SERP brand & sitemaps |
| **Maintenance** | Single file | Automatic via Git workflow | Separate deployment pipeline |
| **Search Intent Depth** | High bounce rate for specific queries | Excellent (dedicated URLs for each error) | Excellent |
| **Recommendation** | **Current Stage (v1.0.0)** | **Recommended Next Stage** | **Future Consideration** |
