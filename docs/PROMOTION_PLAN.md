## 1. Ethical Growth & Distribution Principles

OpenCode Router is an open-source utility built to solve genuine developer network problems. Our distribution strategy adheres strictly to white-hat, developer-first principles:

- **Zero Spam or Bot Submissions**: No automated postings, artificial accounts, purchased upvotes, or fake testimonials.
- **Value-First Engagement**: Postings and discussions must directly answer real technical questions (e.g., resolving HTTP 429, routing CLI tools through SOCKS5 without root).
- **Transparency**: Clear disclosure of project scope, limitations (IP vs account-level limits), and open-source licensing (MIT).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Safety Directive**: All promotional materials and platform profiles below are **prepared drafts**. No accounts will be created and no submissions will be broadcast without explicit user authorization.

## 3. Ready-to-Use Promotional Drafts

### Draft 1: Reddit Project Introduction (For r/commandline or r/Ubuntu)

**Title**: 
OpenCode Router: Automated proxy discovery and isolated routing for OpenCode on Ubuntu (no root needed)

**Post Body**:
```markdown
Hey everyone,

If you use OpenCode (or similar CLI AI coding assistants) on Linux, you've probably hit annoying network drops, ISP throttling, or HTTP 429 rate limits on shared API endpoints.

The traditional fix is turning on a system-wide VPN, but that often breaks local development: it drops active SSH sessions, hijacks DNS, and routes your local web servers and Docker containers through the VPN tunnel.

I built **OpenCode Router** to solve this with application-specific isolation:
- Crawls and tests public V2Ray/Xray configurations (VLESS Reality, VMess, Trojan, Shadowsocks).
- Runs a deterministic 3-stage validation pipeline (TCP ping -> proxy egress probe -> real OpenCode test prompt).
- Differentiates between IP-based rate limits (auto-switches to a fresh node) and account-level quota limits (halts rotation to avoid wasted cycles).
- Runs 100% in user space on high loopback ports (10808/10809) — no sudo or root privileges required.
- Provides a dedicated launcher wrapper (`bin/opencode-vpn`) that sets proxy environment variables strictly for OpenCode, leaving your browser, terminal, and SSH untouched.
- Includes a React 19 web dashboard for real-time telemetry and manual testing.

Tested and verified on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (x86_64).

### Draft 2: Hacker News (Show HN)

**Title**:
Show HN: OpenCode Router – Automated proxy and rate-limit router for OpenCode on Linux

**URL**: `https://github.com/EhsanCreator/OpenCode-Router`

**Initial Maker Comment**:
```text
Hi HN,

I built OpenCode Router (https://github.com/EhsanCreator/OpenCode-Router) to solve a specific annoyance: terminal AI coding assistants failing due to regional censorship or IP-level HTTP 429 rate limits.

Standard VPN clients create system-wide TUN adapters, which hijack the default route (0.0.0.0/0). This routinely breaks local microservices on localhost, severs active SSH sessions, and risks DNS leaks.

Instead of global interception, OpenCode Router uses unprivileged user-space proxying:
1. It manages an internal headless Xray-core instance listening on 127.0.0.1:10808 (SOCKS5) and 10809 (HTTP).
2. It parses public VLESS (with Reality), VMess, Trojan, and Shadowsocks nodes and runs a 3-stage test: raw TCP RTT, proxy HTTP reflection, and an actual execution test through the installed OpenCode binary (`opencode run "..." --pure`).
3. An error classifier categorizes failures: if a provider returns HTTP 429 due to IP throttling, it rotates nodes; if the error is an account quota exhaustion or 401 auth error, it stops rotation immediately.
4. A small Bash wrapper (`bin/opencode-vpn`) sets http_proxy and all_proxy strictly for the sub-process environment and executes OpenCode without modifying host system routing.

The stack is TypeScript, Express, SQLite, and React 19 on the frontend. Tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.

Code is completely open source under MIT. Would appreciate any feedback on the architecture or error-classification heuristics!

### Draft 3: Product Hunt Product Listing

- **Name**: OpenCode Router
- **Tagline**: Automated proxy discovery & rate-limit router for OpenCode on Linux
- **Description**:
  OpenCode Router eliminates connection timeouts and IP-based rate limits for OpenCode users. It automatically discovers, tests, and locks into verified V2Ray/Xray proxy configurations in unprivileged user space. With its dedicated launcher wrapper, only OpenCode traffic is proxied—leaving your local web servers, Docker containers, and SSH sessions completely untouched.
- **Pricing**: Free & Open Source (MIT)
- **First Comment by Maker**:
  "As developers using AI coding assistants in terminal workflows, network timeouts and HTTP 429 throttles kill productivity. Traditional VPNs break local developer setups. We built OpenCode Router to provide targeted, automated failover routing exclusively for OpenCode without needing root privileges. We'd love your thoughts!"
