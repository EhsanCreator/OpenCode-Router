features:
  - icon: ⚡
    title: Automated Node Discovery
    details: Continuously crawls, parses, and normalizes public VLESS, VMess, Trojan, and Shadowsocks proxy nodes from curated GitHub subscriptions.
  - icon: 🎯
    title: 3-Stage Prompt Verification
    details: Executes real multi-stage health probes (TCP ping, proxy HTTP handshake, and actual OpenCode test prompt execution) before locking into a working node.
  - icon: 🛡️
    title: 100% Process Isolation
    details: Routes OpenCode strictly through loopback ports (10808 SOCKS5 / 10809 HTTP) via bin/opencode-vpn without hijacking system-wide routing or SSH.
  - icon: 🧠
    title: Intelligent Error Classifier
    details: Differentiates IP-based HTTP 429 throttles (triggering automatic rotation) from account token exhaustion, avoiding endless wasted cycles.
  - icon: 🔒
    title: Zero-Root Security
    details: Operates entirely as a standard unprivileged user on high ports (>1024). Never prompts for your sudo password during daily use.
  - icon: 📊
    title: Modern Telemetry Dashboard
    details: Real-time telemetry streamed via Server-Sent Events (SSE), search filters, latency charts, and one-click connection switching.
