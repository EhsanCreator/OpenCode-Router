## How to Contribute

- When opening a new issue, describe the problem clearly, including:
  - Ubuntu version (`lsb_release -a`)
  - Node.js version (`node -v`)
  - OpenCode version (`opencode --version`)
  - Error logs (sanitize any private server endpoints or credentials before posting)

## Coding Standards
- Write clean, maintainable TypeScript.
- Follow least-privilege security principles: never require root unless strictly necessary.
- Respect host environment isolation: do not modify global OS routing or interfere with other applications.
- Run tests (`npm test`) and ensure the frontend compiles (`npm run build`) before submitting pull requests.
