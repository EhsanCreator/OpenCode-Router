# OpenCode Proxy vs. System-Wide VPN: Understanding the Differences

When developers encounter network restrictions, regional blocks, or API rate limits while using [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomaly/opencode) on Linux, their first instinct is often to turn on a full system-wide VPN client. However, system-wide VPNs frequently introduce serious workflow friction for programmers. 

This technical article objectively contrasts **System-Wide VPNs (TUN/TAP)** with **Application-Specific Proxy Routing** as implemented in [OpenCode Router](https://github.com/EhsanCreator/OpenCode-Router), explaining the architectural trade-offs, security implications, and developer productivity impacts.

## 1. Architectural Comparison

The fundamental difference lies in **where traffic interception occurs in the Linux networking stack**:

```
[System-Wide VPN Model (TUN/TAP Adapter)]
All Applications (Browser, SSH, Docker, OpenCode, System Updates)
                     │
                     ▼
          Kernel Routing Table (0.0.0.0/0)
                     │
                     ▼
              TUN/TAP Adapter (tun0)
                     │
                     ▼ (ALL traffic redirected to remote gateway)
          Remote VPN Server

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Application-Specific Proxy Model (OpenCode Router)]
Browser, SSH, Docker, OS Updates ──────► Direct Host Network (Default Gateway)

OpenCode CLI (via bin/opencode-vpn)
                     │
                     ▼ (http_proxy & all_proxy)
       Local User-Space Proxy (127.0.0.1:10808/10809)
                     │
                     ▼ (Only OpenCode traffic tunneled)
          Remote Proxy Server
```

## 2. Technical Comparison Matrix

| Evaluation Criteria | System-Wide VPN (TUN/TAP) | Application-Specific Proxy (OpenCode Router) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Traffic Scope** | Global (Entire host operating system) | Isolated (Strictly OpenCode process tree) |
| **Required Privileges** | Root (`sudo`) or `cap_net_admin` | **Unprivileged Standard User** (Zero sudo required) |
| **Local Services Impact** | Frequently breaks `localhost`, Docker bridge networks, and local microservices | **Zero impact** on local microservices, Docker, or dev servers |
| **SSH & Remote Sessions** | Often severs incoming SSH connections by altering default routing table | **Zero disruption** to active SSH, tmux, or terminal sessions |
| **DNS Management** | Overwrites `/etc/resolv.conf` globally, risking system DNS leaks or resolution failures | DNS resolved either remotely through SOCKS5 (`socks5h://`) or untouched locally |
| **Network Overhead** | High (encrypts background system updates, torrents, cloud syncs) | Minimal (only encrypts prompt requests and completions) |
| **Multi-Network Coexistence** | Conflicts with existing corporate VPNs, WireGuard tunnels, or network interfaces | **Fully coexists** with other tunnels and existing network adapters |

## 3. Why System-Wide VPNs Break Developer Workflows

For a software engineer working on Linux (such as **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**), a system-wide VPN introduces distinct operational hazards:

1. **Broken Local Web Servers & Reverse Proxies**: If you are developing a web application on `localhost:3000` or running test suites against local PostgreSQL/Redis containers, global VPN routing rules can intercept loopback traffic or drop split-tunnel packets.
2. **Terminal Session Drops**: If you are connected to a remote workstation or cloud VPS via SSH, launching a full system VPN alters the default route (`0.0.0.0/0`), instantly dropping your SSH session and locking you out.
3. **Unintended Bandwidth & Latency Penalties**: Streaming video, downloading heavy packages (`apt upgrade`, `docker pull`), or syncing git repositories all get routed through the VPN node, adding latency and consuming public VPN quota.
4. **Root Privilege Hazards**: Full VPN clients must manipulate kernel routing tables (`ip route`), requiring persistent root privileges or setuid binaries.

## 4. How OpenCode Router Implements Isolated Proxy Routing

OpenCode Router is **not** a system-wide VPN. It is an **application-specific proxy router**:

1. **Unprivileged High-Port Listeners**: It runs Xray-core as a normal user process, listening exclusively on loopback addresses:
   - SOCKS5 Proxy: `127.0.0.1:10808`
   - HTTP Proxy: `127.0.0.1:10809`
2. **Dedicated Launcher Wrapper (`bin/opencode-vpn`)**: Instead of altering system configuration, the launcher injects environment variables (`http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `all_proxy`) strictly into the OpenCode execution context:
   ```bash
   bin/opencode-vpn run "Refactor this function"
   ```
3. **Zero Configuration Bleed**: When OpenCode finishes execution, no proxy variables linger in your terminal, and no system settings were ever touched.

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Does OpenCode Router encrypt all my internet traffic?
**No.** OpenCode Router intentionally encrypts and routes **only OpenCode traffic**. Your web browser, terminal commands, SSH sessions, and system updates continue using your normal, fast, direct network connection.

### Can I run OpenCode Router if I already use another VPN for work?
**Yes.** Because OpenCode Router operates entirely in user space on loopback high ports (`127.0.0.1:10808`/`10809`) without touching kernel routing tables, it coexists harmoniously with any existing network setup, company VPN, or tunnel.
