## 1. Methodology & Data Disclosure

Search query analysis for specialized developer tools requires identifying the precise vocabulary used by programmers experiencing runtime failures.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Data Integrity Disclosure**: Public search-volume databases (e.g., Ahrefs, SEMrush) do not provide granular, statistically reliable volume for niche open-source CLI keywords. The keywords and search intents documented in this research are derived from observed developer inquiries, terminal error logs, GitHub issue patterns, and technical community discussions, **not fabricated traffic estimates or synthetic search volumes**.

---

## 2. Search Intent Taxonomy

Developers searching for proxy and connectivity solutions for AI coding tools fall into three distinct intent categories:

1. **Troubleshooting Intent (Error-Driven)**: The developer's session failed with a specific error code (e.g., `429 Too Many Requests`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `ECONNREFUSED`). They want a direct, working fix immediately.
2. **Configuration Intent (Task-Driven)**: The developer works behind an enterprise firewall or in a regionally restricted location and needs to know how to pass proxy flags (`http_proxy`, `all_proxy`, SOCKS5) to OpenCode without breaking their OS network.
3. **Architectural & Comparative Intent (Evaluation-Driven)**: The developer wants to understand how application-level proxy routing differs from system-wide TUN clients and why user-space isolation is safer.

| **OpenCode connection issues** | Troubleshooting | High | **Yes**: 3-stage validation pipeline verifies TCP reachability, proxy handshakes, and actual LLM completions. | `docs/articles/fix-opencode-network-errors-linux.md` | **High** |
| **OpenCode rate limit fix** | Troubleshooting | High | **Yes**: Automatic failover state machine rotates nodes until a responsive connection is confirmed. | `docs/articles/fix-opencode-http-429-rate-limit.md` | **High** |
| **AI coding assistant proxy** | Discovery / Architectural | Medium | **Yes**: The architecture demonstrates how command-line AI coding tools can be proxied without system-wide VPN disruption. | `README.md`, `docs/articles/opencode-proxy-vs-system-vpn.md` | **Medium** |
| **SOCKS5 proxy for OpenCode** | Configuration | High | **Yes**: Exposes a local SOCKS5 listener (`127.0.0.1:10808`) specifically mapped to OpenCode via `all_proxy`. | `docs/articles/configure-proxy-opencode-cli.md` | **Medium** |
| **Xray proxy Linux** | Configuration / Integration | Medium | **Yes**: Manages headless Xray-core lifecycle, config generation, and non-root execution. | `docs/articles/use-xray-with-opencode-ubuntu.md` | **Medium** |
| **OpenCode intelligent proxy routing** | Architectural | High | **Yes**: Connection orchestrator ranks nodes by latency, tests them deterministically, and classifies errors. | `README.md`, `docs/SEO_AUDIT.md` | **Medium** |

## 4. Long-Tail Problem Keywords

Long-tail keywords capture developers who paste exact error snippets from their terminals into Google or GitHub search:

| Long-Tail Keyword | Developer Context | Project Solution | Target Article | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| `"opencode 429 Too Many Requests"` | AI provider throttles frequent interactive requests. | Automatic rotation to a fresh egress IP from public node pool. | `fix-opencode-http-429-rate-limit.md` | **High** |
| `"opencode failed to connect to api"` | Regional censorship or DNS poisoning drops endpoint connection. | Multi-protocol Xray tunneling (VLESS Reality/TLS) bypassing blocks. | `fix-opencode-network-errors-linux.md` | **High** |
| `"how to route opencode through socks5"` | User wants proxy support without changing global Linux settings. | Dedicated launcher script `bin/opencode-vpn` setting environment variables per process. | `configure-proxy-opencode-cli.md` | **High** |
| `"opencode proxy without root linux"` | User lacks sudo privileges on shared development server. | Runs on unprivileged loopback ports (`10808`/`10809`), zero sudo needed. | `opencode-proxy-vs-system-vpn.md` | **Medium** |
| `"difference between vpn and opencode proxy"` | User wants to keep local SSH, database, and browser connections normal. | Isolated user-space proxying vs global TUN adapter redirection. | `opencode-proxy-vs-system-vpn.md` | **Medium** |

## 5. Keyword Mapping & Content Strategy

```

└── Focus: Overall architecture, quickstart, automated workflow, installation

[Article 1: fix-opencode-network-errors-linux.md]

```

## 6. Implementation Guidelines

1. **Natural Linguistic Integration**: Keywords must be placed naturally in titles, H2/H3 subheadings, code comments, and explanatory paragraphs.
2. **Zero Keyword Stuffing**: Overusing exact-match phrases degrades technical credibility and triggers search engine penalties.
3. **Honest Limitations**: Never promise that rotating IPs will resolve account-level quota exhaustion or invalid API keys. Technical honesty builds developer trust and reduces bounce rates.
